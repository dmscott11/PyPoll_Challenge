## Overview of Election Audit
The audit of election results was performed as requested by Seth and Tom. The initial candidate results were submitted to the election commission. The election commission followed up with a request to look at the individuals counties election data which includes voter turnout for each county and which county had the largest voter turnout overall. The data that was used to perform the county audit was the same data used to perform the candidate audit.

Broken down, Denver made up both the largest total voter turnout (306,055) as well as the largest total voter turnout by percentage (82.8%). This was followed up Jefferson County, 38,855 total and 10.5%, and Arapahoe County, 24,801 and 6.7%. These counties combined gave us 369,711 total votes which matches the total votes determined in the initial candidate analysis.
