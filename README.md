## Overview of Election Audit
The audit of election results was performed as requested by Seth and Tom. The initial candidate results were submitted to the election commission. The election commission followed up with a request to look at the individuals counties election data which includes voter turnout for each county and which county had the largest voter turnout overall. The data that was used to perform the county audit was the same data used to perform the candidate audit.

*Jefferson County was second with 38,855 total votes and 10.5% of total voter turnout
*Arapahoe County was last third with 24,801 total votes and 6.7% of total voter turnout. 
These counties combined gave us 369,711 total votes which matches the total votes determined in the initial candidate analysis.
